<h1 >David OReilly</h1> 
<P style=font-family:Georgia;font-size:30px>David OReilly (born 1985 in Kilkenny, Ireland) is an Irish film maker and artist based in Los Angeles, California, US. He is known for creating distinctive 3D animated films.</P>

<tr>
<h2>Work</h2>
<td style=font-family:Georgia;font-size:30px> His first was Mountain, released in July 2014 in partnership with Double Fine Productions for personal computers and mobile devices. Mountain features little interactivity but allows the player to create and watch a solitary mountain floating in space as it offers its thoughts to the player, and as random objects collide and become embedded within it. It was generally praised by critics, noting it as a subversion what one normally expects for a video game
In 2016, OReilly announced a second game, Everything, a "simulator of everything", on which the player can play as anything, from bacteria to galaxies.Everything was released on March 21, 2017 on PlayStation 4, with Windows and Mac versions to follow on April 21, 2017</td>

<h2>Style</h2>
<td style=font-family:Georgia;font-size:30px> OReilly's work is often characterized by the use of intentionally stripped down 3d graphics. He is known for popularizing the use of low-poly 3d and the use of 3d software as a personal and artistic tool, as outlined in his 2009 essay "Basic Animation Aesthetics".He was an early adopter of glitch effects and uses elements of the software used inside his work.</td>
